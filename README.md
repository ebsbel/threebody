# threebody
Simulation of the three body problem using physical laws and three different neural network methods.

## Simulation
To simulate the three bodies using physical laws, use the notebook ThreeBodyProblem_SimulationOfBodies.ipynb.

## Neural networks
Several methods are tested in the notebook structuredthreebodyproblemmodelling-kaggle.ipynb.
